## My process

The HTML was the easiest part for me so I started out and finished it first. Then for each of the elements I started writing CSS properties. I didn't use JavaScript because I am still learning and didn't want to get into too mmuch detail so that I will learn everything in a step by step manner. I struggled a lot with hover transitions and the image transisition part is still inprogress.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I thought HTML and CSS are very easy for me and I can handle things but for each CSS property I had to learn what arguments to provide and how to write them properly.
- Doing one thing at a time is pretty helpful.
- Doing this challenge gave me insights on how I will have to design a application in future.
- I have never used svg before and now I know something about svg's.


### Continued development

I will continue focusing on CSS properties because there are ton of properties out their and I wish to try as and when I encounter their need. I will also try to improve the style and use style guides available so it will help me in choosing the correct styling and design for my future projects.
